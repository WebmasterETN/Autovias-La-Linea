      "Traveling with Autovías means discovering that every destination holds more than just landscapes—it holds stories, encounters, and moments that stay with you. Our buses offer the comfort you deserve, so you can enjoy the journey as much as the place you're headed to.",
      "Because traveling through Mexico isn’t just about arriving—it’s about letting the road guide you, taking in the view, and feeling that every stop has a story to tell. Your next journey doesn’t begin on a map—it begins with what you feel when you move."
